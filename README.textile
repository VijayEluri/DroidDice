h1. DroidDice1

DroidDice1 is a dice rolling application for Android devices. Features include:

* Multiple die types (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)
* Exploding dice (as in Savage Worlds
* Save commonly used sets of dice
* Track previous rolls

I wrote DroidDice just after I got my G1 android phone, before there was even an Android Market. I
mainly wrote it as a way to learn Android programming.

h2. Compiling

DroidDice2 was developed with eclispe, and uses the standard ADK tooling. I generally compile using the 
command line with Ant. To get started, you need to create a file named system.properties in the base 
directory that tells ant where the android SDK is.
